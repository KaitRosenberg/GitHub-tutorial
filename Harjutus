GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people. 
GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software
developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized
repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.
